    <h2 class="resource">Sports</h2>
    <p class="resource">I have been doing Judo since I was 8 years old, about 2 years ago I left it aside as i couldn´t handle all, studies and
        sport, but I have recently come back to it. Recently I have developed a new passion, cyclism, I use to go out in
        sunny days and spend a couple hours pedaling. I also love swimming and I usually go to the pool on weekends.</p>
    <h2 class="resource">Films</h2>
    <p class="resource">I love both science fiction and fantasy, as a result of that one of my favourite films are the Star Wars saga, and the
        Lord of the Rings which I consider are cynematographic masterpieces. My favourite directors are Tarantino, Spielberg
        and Ridley Scott.
    </p>
    <h2 class="resource">Music</h2>
    <p class="resource">In fact I listen to every kind of music, in my day to day music I usually listen to rock / heavy or pop-rock music, though
        I love dancing, so I also listen from reggaeton (Pobre Diabla is the best reggaeton song ever) to electronic dance
        music

    <p class="resource">I have being reading a lot since I was a kid and as with movies I love science fiction and fantasy, like Harry Potter
        and The Lord of The Rings(again). Also I read more general types of books, although I hate romantic and thrillers.</p>
    <p class="resource">Here is the list of some books I specially recommend or like:</p>

    <h2 class="resource">VideoGames</h2>
    <p class="resource">I love videogames, I started playing as a kid with my sister's game boy and I get thrilled about them. I play almost every genre but I dont like horror or online competitive games like LoL o Overwatch. I prefer RPGs with a good story in which I can dive in, stealth or strategy games.</p>
