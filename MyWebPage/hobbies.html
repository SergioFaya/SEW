    <h2>Sports</h2>
    <p>I have been doing Judo since I was 8 years old, about 2 years ago I left it aside as i couldn´t handle all, studies and sport, but I have recently come back to it. 
        Recently I have developed a new passion, cyclism, I use to go out in sunny days and spend a couple hours pedaling. I also love swimmng and I usually go to the pool on weekends.</p>
    <h2>Films</h2>
    <p>I love both science fiction and fantasy, as a result of that one of my favourite films are the Star Wars saga, and the Lord of the Rings which I consider are cynematographic masterpieces. 
        My favourite directors are Tarantino, Spielberg and Ridley Scott.
    </p>
    <h2>Music</h2>
    <p>In fact I consume every kind of music, in my day to day music I usually listen to rock / heavy or pop-rock music, though I love dancing, so I also listen from reggaeton 
        (Pobre Diabla is the best reggaeton song ever) to electronic dance music</p>
    <p>Some of my favourite groups are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Linkin Park</li>
        <li>Marea</li>
        <li>Queen</li>
        <li>Metallica</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Books</h2>
    <p>I have being reading a lot since I was a kid and as with movies I love science fiction and fantasy, like Harry Potter and The Lord of The Rings(again). Also read more general types of books, although I hate romantic and thrillers.</p>
